        The Universe is all of space and time (spacetime) and its contents,
        which includes planets, moons, stars, galaxies, the contents of
        intergalactic space and all matter and energy. While the size of the
        entire Universe is still unknown, it is possible to measure the
        observable universe.
      </li>
      <li>
        The earliest scientific models of the Universe were developed by ancient
        Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the
        centre of the Universe.Over the centuries, more precise astronomical
        observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model
        with the Sun at the centre of the Solar System. In developing the law of
        universal gravitation, Sir Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as
        well as observations by Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler's laws of
        planetary motion.
      </li>

        Further observational improvements led to the realization that our Solar
        System is located in the Milky Way galaxy, which is one of many galaxies
        in the Universe. It is assumed that galaxies are distributed uniformly
        and the same in all directions, meaning that the Universe has neither an
        edge nor a center. Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested
        that the Universe had a beginning and that it is expanding at an
        increasing rate. The majority of mass in the Universe appears to exist
        in an unknown form called dark matter.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological description of the
        development of the Universe. Under this theory, space and time emerged
        together 13.799Â±0.021 billion years ago with a fixed amount of energy
        and matter that has become less dense as the Universe has expanded.
        After the initial expansion, the Universe cooled, allowing the first
        subatomic particles to form and then simple atoms. Giant clouds later
        merged through gravity to form galaxies, stars, and everything else seen
        today. It is possible to see objects that are now further away than
        13.799 billion light-years because space itself has expanded. This means
        that objects which are now 46 billion light years away can still be seen
        in their distant past, because at that time they were much closer to us.
