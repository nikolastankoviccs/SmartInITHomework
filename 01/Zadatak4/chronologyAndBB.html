      The prevailing model for the evolution of the Universe is the Big Bang
      theory. The Big Bang model states that the earliest state of the Universe
      was extremely hot and dense and that it subsequently expanded. The model
      is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as
      homogeneity and isotropy of space. A version of the model with a
      cosmological constant (Lambda) and cold dark matter, known as the
      Lambda-CDM model, is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good
      account of various observations about the Universe. The Big Bang model
      accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and redshift
      of galaxies, the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the
      microwave radiation background.

      The initial hot, dense state is called the Planck epoch, a brief period
      extending from time zero to one Planck time unit of approximately 10−43
      seconds. During the Planck epoch, all types of matter and all types of
      energy were concentrated into a dense state, where gravitation is believed
      to have been as strong as the other fundamental forces, and all the forces
      may have been unified. Since the Planck epoch, the Universe has been
      expanding to its present form, possibly with a very brief period of cosmic
      inflation which caused the Universe to reach a much larger size in less
      than 10−32 seconds. After the Planck epoch and inflation came the quark,
      hadron, and lepton epochs. Together, these epochs encompassed less than 10
      seconds of time following the Big Bang. The observed abundance of the
      elements can be explained by combining the overall expansion of space with
      nuclear and atomic physics. As the Universe expands, the energy density of
      electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that of matter
      because the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength. As the
      Universe expanded and cooled, elementary particles associated stably into
      ever larger combinations. Thus, in the early part of the matter-dominated
      era, stable protons and neutrons formed, which then formed atomic nuclei
      through nuclear reactions. This process, known as Big Bang
      nucleosynthesis, led to the present abundances of lighter nuclei,
      particularly hydrogen, deuterium, and helium. Big Bang nucleosynthesis
      ended about 20 minutes after the Big Bang, when the Universe had cooled
      enough so that nuclear fusion could no longer occur. At this stage, matter
      in the Universe was mainly a hot, dense plasma of negatively charged
      electrons, neutral neutrinos and positive nuclei. This era, called the
      photon epoch, lasted about 380 thousand years.

      Eventually, at a time known as recombination, electrons and nuclei formed
      stable atoms, which are transparent to most wavelengths of radiation. With
      photons decoupled from matter, the Universe entered the matter-dominated
      era. Light from this era could travel freely, and it can still be seen in
      the Universe as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). After around 100
      million years, the first stars formed; these were likely very massive,
      luminous, and responsible for the reionization of the Universe. Having no
      elements heavier than lithium, these stars also produced the first heavy
      elements through stellar nucleosynthesis. The Universe also contains a
      mysterious energy called dark energy, the density of which does not change
      over time. After about 9.8 billion years, the Universe had expanded
      sufficiently so that the density of matter was less than the density of
      dark energy, marking the beginning of the present dark-energy-dominated
      era. In this era, the expansion of the Universe is accelerating due to
      dark energy.
