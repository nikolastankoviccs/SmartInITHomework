    <h1><i>Mythologies</i></h1>
    <p>
      Many cultures have stories describing the origin of the world and
      universe. Cultures generally regard these stories as having some truth.
      There are however many differing beliefs in how these stories apply
      amongst those believing in a supernatural origin, ranging from a god
      directly creating the Universe as it is now to a god just setting the
      "wheels in motion" (for example via mechanisms such as the big bang and
      evolution). Ethnologists and anthropologists who study myths have
      developed various classification schemes for the various themes that
      appear in creation stories. For example, in one type of story, the world
      is born from a world egg; such stories include the Finnish epic poem
      Kalevala, the Chinese story of Pangu or the Indian Brahmanda Purana. In
      related stories, the Universe is created by a single entity emanating or
      producing something by him- or herself, as in the Tibetan Buddhism concept
      of Adi-Buddha, the ancient Greek story of Gaia (Mother Earth), the Aztec
      goddess Coatlicue myth, the ancient Egyptian god Atum story, and the
      Judeo-Christian Genesis creation narrative in which the Abrahamic God
      created the Universe. In another type of story, the Universe is created
      from the union of male and female deities, as in the Maori story of Rangi
      and Papa. In other stories, the Universe is created by crafting it from
      pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god — as from Tiamat
      in the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish or from the giant Ymir in Norse
      mythology – or from chaotic materials, as in Izanagi and Izanami in
      Japanese mythology. In other stories, the Universe emanates from
      fundamental principles, such as Brahman and Prakrti, the creation myth of
      the Serers, or the yin and yang of the Tao.

    <h1><i>Philosophical models</i></h1>
    <p>
      The pre-Socratic Greek philosophers and Indian philosophers developed some
      of the earliest philosophical concepts of the Universe. The earliest Greek
      philosophers noted that appearances can be deceiving, and sought to
      understand the underlying reality behind the appearances. In particular,
      they noted the ability of matter to change forms (e.g., ice to water to
      steam) and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials
      in the world are different forms of a single primordial material, or
      arche. The first to do so was Thales, who proposed this material to be
      water. Thales' student, Anaximander, proposed that everything came from
      the limitless apeiron. Anaximenes proposed the primordial material to be
      air on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that
      cause the arche to condense or dissociate into different forms. Anaxagoras
      proposed the principle of Nous (Mind), while Heraclitus proposed fire (and
      spoke of logos). Empedocles proposed the elements to be earth, water, air
      and fire. His four-element model became very popular. Like Pythagoras,
      Plato believed that all things were composed of number, with Empedocles'
      elements taking the form of the Platonic solids. Democritus, and later
      philosophers—most notably Leucippus—proposed that the Universe is composed
      of indivisible atoms moving through a void (vacuum), although Aristotle
      did not believe that to be feasible because air, like water, offers
      resistance to motion. Air will immediately rush in to fill a void, and
      moreover, without resistance, it would do so indefinitely fast.
